# Hearth Crafting Recipes
#
# Each recipe defines how materials can be transformed through crafting actions.
# Action types: combine (mix items), work (shape material), apply (use tool/heat)
#
# Schema:
#   name: output item type
#   action: combine | work | apply
#   inputs: list of required input item types
#           - for combine: items to mix (order-independent)
#           - for work: single material
#           - for apply: [tool_or_heat_source, target] (order matters!)
#   technique: technique name (for work actions only)
#   output_quantity: how many items produced (default: 1)
#   output_stackable: whether output stacks (default: true)
#   properties: list of properties on output item
#   discoveries: hints about further crafting possibilities
