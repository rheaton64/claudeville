# Hearth World Settings
#
# Centralizes configurable values used across the simulation.
# Values here can be overridden by code for testing or special scenarios.

vision:
  # How far agents can see (radius in cells, so 3 = 7x7 grid)
  default_radius: 3
  # Multiplier for night vision (0.6 = 60% of normal)
  night_modifier: 0.6

scheduling:
  # Extra buffer around vision radius for clustering
  # Agents within (vision_radius + cluster_buffer) may interact
  cluster_buffer: 2
  # How many ticks before an unanswered invitation expires
  invite_expiry_ticks: 2

world:
  # Default world dimensions (used by --init)
  default_width: 500
  default_height: 500

terrain_generation:
  # WFC batch size (higher = faster but more memory)
  batch_size: 2000
  # How often to snapshot for backtracking
  snapshot_interval: 10000
  # Max backtracks before full restart
  max_backtracks: 50
  # Full restarts before giving up
  max_retries: 10

agent_placement:
  # Distance range between agents (Manhattan distance)
  min_distance: 30
  max_distance: 60
  # Search radius from world center
  search_radius: 100
  # Max attempts to find valid positions
  max_attempts: 100
